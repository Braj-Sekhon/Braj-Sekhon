# Hi, I'm Braj
High school senior passionate about machine learning, procedural generation, and computational mathematics. Aspiring research professor focused on problems at the intersection of clever algorithms and computational scale.

## Featured Projects

**[Incremental Strategy Game](https://www.roblox.com/games/15902657474/)** - Reached 200k+ organic players. Optimized server performance by replacing recursive pricing with closed-form geometric series solution (O(n) → O(1)), eliminating a source of massive lag.

**[Self-Hosted Web Infrastructure](https://github.com/Braj-Sekhon/Website)** - Built understanding of web infrastructure from first principles: self-hosted static site w/ Apache → DNS/SSL w/ Argo Tunnel → converted to SvelteKit & deployed on Vercel.

**[Multi-Threaded Lottery Simulator](https://github.com/Braj-Sekhon/lottery-sim)** - Achieved 6.7× speedup through multi-threading with batched updates to eliminate lock contention. Learned that more threads ≠ better performance without careful synchronization design.

**[Notes Manager](https://github.com/Braj-Sekhon/notes-manager)** - Windows desktop app with embedded file browser—no more file dialog popups. Includes honest reflection on why my 'encryption' isn't real encryption.
