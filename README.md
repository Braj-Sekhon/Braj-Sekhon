High school senior passionate about machine learning, procedural generation, and computational mathematics. Aspiring research professor focused on problems at the intersection of clever algorithms and computational scale.

## Featured Projects

**[Incremental Strategy Game](https://www.roblox.com/games/15902657474/)** - Reached 200k+ organic players. Optimized server performance by replacing recursive pricing with closed-form geometric series solution (O(n) → O(1)), eliminating a source of massive lag.

**[Self-Hosted Web Infrastructure](https://github.com/Braj-Sekhon/Website)** - Built understanding of web infrastructure from first principles: Apache on my PC → DNS/SSL configuration → SvelteKit deployment on Vercel.

**[Multi-Threaded Lottery Simulator](https://github.com/Braj-Sekhon/lottery-sim)** - Achieved 6.7× performance improvement by eliminating lock contention through batched updates. Learned that more threads ≠ better performance.

**[Notes Manager](https://github.com/Braj-Sekhon/notes-manager)** - Windows desktop app with embedded file navigation. Includes honest reflection on why my "encryption" is really just scrambling.
